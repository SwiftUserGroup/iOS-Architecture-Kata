#iOS Architecture Kata

---

This repos is inspired to projects like [todo mvc](http://todomvc.com) and [Real World Example apps](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld). The main goal is to apply the most common iOS architecture patterns in a _non-trivial_ example.

##The sample App

The app should:

* Fetch the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
* Show the list of the most starred Swift projects, showing the name of the project, the owner and the number of stars.
* When the user clicks on the item, open a view with more details.


##TBD

- Tracking
- No internet
- Login
- Onboarding?
- Error management
- SubViewController
- Test
